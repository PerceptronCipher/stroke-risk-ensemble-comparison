# 🏥 Stroke Risk Prediction System

Hey there! Welcome to my stroke prediction project. This system predicts whether someone might be at risk of having a stroke based on their health data. Pretty exciting stuff!

## What's This All About?

I grabbed this amazing dataset from Kaggle with patient information - their age, smoking habits, glucose levels, and more. Then I applied some machine learning magic to see if we can predict stroke risk. And guess what? It works really well!

The model achieved about 77% accuracy in spotting patterns. Not too shabby for a personal project!

## Getting Started (Super Simple!)

**Step 1: Grab the code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stroke-risk-ensemble-comparison.git
cd stroke-risk-ensemble-comparison
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

python run_all.py

streamlit run src/deploy.py
You now have a live web app! Open it in your browser and start making predictions.


How It Works
The Data Preparation (preprocessing.py)
First up - cleaning time! Some patients didn't record their BMI, so I filled those gaps with sensible values. Then I converted all the categorical data (like "Male" and "Female") into numbers since that's what machine learning models prefer.
Here's something interesting - only about 5% of people in the dataset had strokes. That's a huge imbalance! So I used a technique called SMOTE to create balanced training data. It generates synthetic examples of stroke cases so the model learns from both outcomes equally.
The Training Process (train.py)
I tested three powerful algorithms:

Random Forest (our champion!)
XGBoost
LightGBM

Random Forest won with a 0.77 ROC-AUC score. While I'd love to see higher numbers, predicting strokes is genuinely challenging. Even experienced doctors find this difficult!
The Interactive App (deploy.py)
I built a friendly Streamlit app where you input patient information and get instant predictions. It features dropdown menus, number inputs, and a big predict button. Click it and voila - you get a comprehensive risk assessment with confidence scores!
Key Takeaways
This project taught me some valuable lessons:

Medical data presents unique challenges, especially with class imbalance
Predicting rare health events requires careful model selection
Random Forest remains incredibly effective even in 2024
SMOTE significantly improves model performance on imbalanced datasets

The model tends to be conservative with predictions (which is good for health applications). It might occasionally flag false positives, but missing an actual stroke risk would be far more concerning.
Want to Make It Better?
Here are some enhancement ideas:

Experiment with neural networks for potentially better performance
Create additional engineered features from existing data
Expand the dataset with more patient records
Fine-tune hyperparameters more extensively
Try ensemble methods combining multiple top models

Tech Stack
The main tools powering this project:

pandas & numpy - data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn - machine learning foundation
XGBoost & LightGBM - advanced gradient boosting models

Troubleshooting
If you hit any snags:

Double-check all packages from requirements.txt are installed
Verify you're using Python 3.10 or higher
Ensure the data file is in the correct directory
Feel free to open an issue - I'm happy to help!

Important Note
This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes. While the model performs well, it should never replace professional medical advice. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for health concerns.
Final Words
Building this was an incredible learning experience! Healthcare machine learning is both fascinating and humbling - it really highlights the complexity of human health. The model is a useful tool, but it's meant to assist, not replace medical expertise.
Thanks so much for checking out my project! I hope you find it interesting and maybe even learn something new. Feel free to fork it, improve it, or use it as inspiration for your own projects!
Stay healthy and keep coding!
